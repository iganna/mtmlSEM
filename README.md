# mtmlSEM

Construction and estimation of mtmlSEM models


## Description

There are a plethora of methods for genome-wide association studies. However, only a few of them may be classified as multi-trait and multi-locus, i.e. consider the influence of multiple genetic variants to several correlated phenotypes. We propose a multi-trait multi-locus model which employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to describe complex associations between SNPs and traits - multi-trait multi-locus SEM (mtmlSEM). The structure of our model makes it possible to discriminate pleiotropic and single-trait SNPs of direct and indirect effect. 
We also propose an automatic procedure to construct the model using factor analysis and the maximum likelihood method. For estimating a large number of parameters in the model, we performed Bayesian inference and implemented Gibbs sampling. An important feature of the model is that it correctly copes with non-normally distributed variables, such as some traits and variants.
